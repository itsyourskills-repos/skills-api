Welcome to the official documentation for ISOT, a comprehensive database designed to manage a diverse collection of skills. In this documentation, you will find detailed information on how to navigate the ISOT database, understand its hierarchical structure, and efficiently retrieve valuable skills for various purposes.

## Overview

ISOT encompasses a wide array of skills, including knowledge, activities, tools and technologies, soft skills, certifications, domain experience, and more. The core concept revolves around organizing these skills in a hierarchical structure to facilitate seamless navigation and efficient retrieval.

## Skill Hierarchy

The collection of skills in the ISOT database is organized hierarchically, providing a systematic approach to categorize and understand relationships among various skills. For instance, a specific skill like `JavaScript programming` can be categorized under a broader skill category such as "Web Development," which, in turn, may be grouped under a higher-level skill category like "Computer Science." This hierarchical arrangement ensures a logical and structured representation of skills.
